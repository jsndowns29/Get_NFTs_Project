This app takes in a user ethereum wallet address and displays NFTs from specified NFT collections. The user can either connect their ethereum wallet or enter the address manually. Collection contract addresses can be added or removed in the src/settings folder. By default, the app displays NFTs from the Learn Web3 DAO and Build Space collections.

This address: 0x72A69e7dAb96e415A42b4fa841DbAA899Ab780F6 contains NFTs from both default libraries and can be used for testing.
